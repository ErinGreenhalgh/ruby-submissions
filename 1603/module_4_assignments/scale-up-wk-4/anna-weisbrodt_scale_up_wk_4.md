### Participation

I participated in standup every day this week. I have not yet posted or responded to a PR, but plan to do so over the weekend and/or next week. 

### Work Completed

Research/prep: My research and prep including some background and documentation reading on React, and reading a few post posts. I also completed two React tutorials, the Creact tutorial from Lovisa S.,
and [this tutorial](https://www.airpair.com/reactjs/posts/reactjs-a-guide-for-rails-developers#nesting-components-listing-records), which uses coffee but I converted to jsx/ES6, with occasional
reference to a github repo mentioned in the tutorial's comments.
[Link to my completed tutorial](https://github.com/AnnaCW/accounts-react-rails-jsx-ES6)

Project work: I set up react-rails in my project, and have (almost) successfully converted one of my views to React using two React components.
My main challenge stemmed from trying to handle two instance variables in one view. My process here is described in more detail in my draft blog.
The last piece to have a working view is to get the spotify iframes (that play tracks) working. I think this is just a matter of fixing the string interpolation in the iframe url.
