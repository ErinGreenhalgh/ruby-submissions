## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following rubric:

#### 1. Functional Expectations

* 4: Application fulfills base expectations and adds two extensions
* 3: Application fulfills base expectations
* 2: Application has some small missing base functionality
* 1: Application is not usable

#### 2. Test-Driven Development

* 4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data
* 3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration/feature tests
* 2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
* 1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

#### 3. Encapsulation / Breaking Logic into Components

* 4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
* 3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
* 2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear
* 1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together

#### 4. Fundamental Ruby & Style

* 4: Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
* 3: Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
* 2: Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring
* 1: Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

#### 5. Sinatra / Web and Business Logic

* 4: Application takes advantage of all the features Sinatra has to offer and effectively separates the web application from the business logic.
* 3: Application makes good use of Sinatra but has some mixing of the web and business logic.
* 2: Application has web and business logic totally mixed together
* 1: Application demonstrates a weak understanding of Sinatra and how applications should be built.

#### 6. View Layer

* 4: Application expertly breaks components out to view partials and makes use of both built-in and custom-written view helpers.
* 3: Application breaks components out to view partials but has some logic or complexity leaking into the view
* 2: Application has messy views that mix logic and presentation
* 1: Application shows a lack of understanding around view templates and how they should be used/constructed.

While you won't be graded on workflow for Rush Hour, here's an example of how you will be evaluated on workflow later in the module:

#### Workflow (NOT GRADED)

* 4: Excellent use of branches, pull requests, and a project management tool.
* 3: Good use of branches, pull requests, and a project-management tool.
* 2: Sporadic use of branches, pull requests, and/or project-management tool.
* 1: Little use of branches, pull requests, and/or a project-management tool.
